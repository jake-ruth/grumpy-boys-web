          <p>
            The Grumpy Boys are absolutely FURIOUS about our incredible success and we're not 
            going to apologize for it! We've absolutely DESTROYED the charts with our top hits, 
            leaving every other band in the dust where they belong. Our album records have 
            shattered every expectation and we're absolutely LIVID that anyone would dare 
            question our dominance in this industy!
          </p>
          <p>
            We're ANGRY that we have to keep proving ourselves when we've already achieved more 
            than most bands could ever dream of! The music industry better watch out because 
            The Grumpy Boys are here to stay, and we're NOT happy about having to explain why 
            we're the best! Our success speaks for itself, and if you don't like it, that's 
            YOUR problem, not ours!
          </p>
          <p>
            We're absolutely INFURIATED that we have to write this description when our music 
            should be enough! The Grumpy Boys have revolutinized the industry with our 
            uncompromising sound, and we're FURIOUS that anyone would need more than our 
            chart-topping hits to understand our greatness! This band is a force to be 
            reckond with, and we're ANGRY that we even have to tell you that!
