Create the following webapp using the latest nextjs:

# The Grumpy Boys

# PAGES

## Home Page

- Two images one of Dave Reddick and the other of Jake Ruth
- 5 sentence description about our band. We have top hits, album records, and much more. The band is very successful
- Links to the grumpy boys blog posts

## About Page

- A very angry sounding description of the band. Just like home page but angrier

## Blog Page

- 10 blog posts about coal, green initiatives, and the job market in regards to mining and coal. Make them all have the coal theme but they should all contradict each other. Make each post 5 paragraphs long.
- Each post should have an iframe to a youtube video about coal and the uses for it, if you can't find any, just put placeholders for me

  #2F5D50 deep forest green
